# Sharing is Caring Proposal
## Section 1
My sharing is caring piece will start with multiple sequencers running simultaneously. They will have similar but not the same timbre and will be moving from high pitches to low pitches at different intervals. On top of these background/base layer sequencers, there will be a louder sequencer on top serving as the melody. Around 30-45 seconds into the piece, the player will trigger different electronic noises (like robot noises) and foley-esque sound effects at their discretion. After that, it's time to free all the synths and add some white noise. 

## Section 2
The white noise will have little robot noises the player can trigger throuhgout. This white noise section will last around 20-30 seconds. 

## Section 3
As the white noise section ends, there will be some sort of percussion and new synths that are chordal + sparkly. This section wouldn't require a lot of player input; they can just chill here. The player will release all the synths at the end of the section and bring back the white noise from before. They will immediately start triggering the robot noises. 

## Section 4
Same as Section 2 but with different effects for the white noise. The user can choose from:

- High pass filter
- Low pass filter
- Delay/chorus effect

## Section 5
Section 1 with percussion and a melody that the player can start and stop at any time. This section will have a fade out.
